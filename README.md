# Watercolor Washes Creator Web Application

To build a web app that facilitates creating multiple washes from an input photo, several key components need to be considered, including the technology stack, user interface design, and functionality. Here's a detailed approach to get started.

### 1. Core Functionality

- **Photo Upload:** Allow users to upload the input photo.
- **Wash Effects:** Create options for various wash effects (e.g., grayscale, sepia, duotone).
- **Customization:** Offer sliders or controls to adjust parameters like intensity, color balance, and contrast.
- **Preview:** Show a live preview of the applied wash effects.
- **Download Options:** Enable users to download the processed images in different formats.
